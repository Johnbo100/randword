Problems:

1. when trying to generate different permutations with strings of more than 7 letters the possible permutations are in the many thousands which is impossible to visualise for people to see. Therefore useless.

2. When trying to show the permutations progress with a progress bar the progress bar its self re renders to many times and the program fails.
